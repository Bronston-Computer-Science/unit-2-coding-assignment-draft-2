# Follow these instructions:

2. Create a file named Car.java.

3. Define a class named `Car` in the `Car.java` file with the following structure:

-  A constructor that initialises the following properties:

   -  make (String)
   -  model (String)
   -  year (int)
   -  mileage (double) - in kilometers

-  Create the following methods within the class:
   -  `carDetails`: Returns a string containing the car's make, model, and year in the format: "Make Model (Year)".
   -  `addMileage`: Accepts an integer parameter km and adds it to the car's current mileage. The method should return the updated mileage.

3. Create a separate file named `Assignment.java` within the same folder as `Car.java`. Import the Car class into this file.

4. In your `Assignment.java` file:

-  Use the Car class to:
   -  Instantiate an object with sample values.
   -  Print all the car details of your object using the `carDetails` method.
   -  Update the mileage of your object using the `addMileage` method and display the updated mileage.
